# Course title: Introduction to applied machine learning

This repository contains Python notebooks used a course called Introduction to Applied Machine Learning during my time studying an Informatics Msc at Edinburgh University. The files titled with 'assignment' were, coincidentally enough, assignments and generally took the form of training, validating and testing data using different machine learning algorithms. The files entitled with 'lab' somewhere in the name were used as practise for assignments - not all are completed but have been kept for future reference.
