# Introductory applied machine learning (INFR10069)

This folder contains labs and assignments complete for a module called Introductory Applied Machine Learning at the University of Edinburgh, which I scored 83% for overall, including exams. The files contain lots of fun and fascinating things such as object recognition within photos and working with classic machine learning datasets.
